"""The explode/pack transform seam — environment-mode ``Substitution`` adapter.

``explode`` and ``pack`` are a pure version-control core that knows nothing about
connections (ADR-0002). They accept a **transform** and apply it to every parsed JSON
entry. A transform is **two-phase**:

    apply(parsed)        -- mutate one parsed entry in place, remembering any problems
    raise_if_problems()  -- called once after every entry is computed and *before* any
                            output is written; raises a typed error listing all problems

Splitting the work this way preserves the core's compute-then-write guarantee: a bad
*entry* aborts the whole operation before the filesystem is touched, and the user is
shown *every* offender at once rather than failing on the first.

The two phases cover **per-entry** problems — an unregistered connection string on
explode, a missing token key on pack — the things only discoverable by walking each
entry. Whole-Project **preconditions** (a malformed ``aprx.json``, a value mapped to two
keys, a chosen environment file that doesn't exist) are resolved earlier, when the
factory asks its ``ProjectConfig`` for the map, and fail fast there via ``ProjectConfig``'s
own hard errors — there is nothing to accumulate before a usable map exists.

``Substitution`` is the environment-mode transform, built from a ``ProjectConfig``:

    Substitution.for_explode(cfg)            -- tokenize: connection string -> @@token@@
    Substitution.for_pack(cfg, env=...)      -- substitute: @@token@@ -> connection string

It is a thin adapter over the pure engine in :mod:`aprx_tools.connections`, which already
operates on parsed JSON (never text) so values containing backslashes, semicolons or
quotes re-serialise with correct escaping. ``Substitution`` adds three things: a factory
that picks the direction, a map sourced from ``ProjectConfig``, and ownership of the
error wording — keeping that wording out of the connection-ignorant core.

The simple-mode counterpart is ``IDENTITY``: a no-op transform whose ``apply`` passes
the entry through untouched and whose ``raise_if_problems`` never raises. It is what makes
the seam *real* — the core can be exercised end-to-end with zero connection setup — and it
is the transform the composition root injects when a Project is in simple mode.
